# ECSR-New-Item-Notifier
Sends you a message in telegram if new item was uploaded or already existing item was set ON SALE (it means you can catch booster early drop items without being a booster on their server!!!)


Usage:

You need python-telegram-bot module with 13.15 version
Install it by doing this: pip install python-telegram-bot==13.15 (in CMD)

After that you go to @BotFather in telegram and you make a bot.

When you made a bot you'll get a token, it looks like this: "81xxx00xxx:xxxgZziq_Sxxxx_rxxxxkwxxxxxxxxFPxx" (censored for obvious reason)

Then you paste it in TELEGRAM_TOKEN variable at the top of snipe.py file

# Enter this bot: @GetAnyTelegramIdBot
Get your telegram account ID and paste it in variable TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID

Now leave it working on background (Enable notifications for bots so you can receive a sound-notification)
